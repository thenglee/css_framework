## Framework

#### About

The Framework web styling project is based on [Udacity's Intro to HTML and CSS course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud304). This project focuses on creating the CSS classes that forms the 12-grid framework.

The index page is styled using the created 12-grid framework and is based on the mock design [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/2872198569/mock3-portfolio-1.pdf).
